<h1>Top 3 Movies according to Me!</h1>

    <h2>This are my top 3 movies of all time.</h2>

<hr />

    <h3>The Notebook</h3>
        <p>The Notebook to me is a classic romance movie that has<br />just the right amount of all emotions.</p>

    <h3>Godzilla vs Kong</h3>
        <p>I am a big fan of the Titan movies but this is by far one of my favourites.<br />
            The fight scenes between Titans, Godzilla and Kong were too good.</p>

    <h3>Transformers: The Last Knight</h3>
        <p>This is my all-time favourite Transformers movie as it shows how the Transformers came to earth<br />
        and it showcases the friendship of Bumblebee and Optimus Prime.</p>
